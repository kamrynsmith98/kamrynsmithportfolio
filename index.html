    <p>
     I'm Kamryn, a passionate and creative Ad Tech Specialist with a proven track record of boosting efficiency and identifying key areas for improvement across key clients such as Publix &amp; Grammarly.
     Since February 2022, I've been with 22Squared, where I oversee and traffic all Publix Campaigns. I work closely with both internal employees and external clients(Spotify, Pandora, NBC, Hulu, CBS etc.) that work hand and hand with Publix. I also work with businesses that help maxamize Publix's brand and campaign performance across various third party trackers/vendors. My role also extends to collaborating with both new and existing employees on our trafficking process and ways to improve campaign development and effective planning. 
    <br>
      Originally from Connecticut, I spent my most formative years in Tampa, Florida where I earned a degree in New Media
