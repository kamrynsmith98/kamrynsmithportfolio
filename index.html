    <p>
I'm Kamryn, an Ad Tech Specialist with a strong expertise in campaign trafficking, digital media operations, and performance optimization. In my role, I manage and traffic all Publix campaigns, ensuring seamless execution and maximizing efficiency. I work closely with internal teams and external partners—including Spotify, Pandora, NBC, Hulu, and CBS—to streamline tag delivery and enhance campaign performance through various third party trackers (ex: Acxiom R-Tag). Additionally, I collaborate with various vendors to ensure accurate data measurement, campaign insights, and continuous improvements for Publix Media.
    <br><br>
      Originally from Connecticut, I spent my most formative years in Tampa, Florida where I earned a degree in New Media &amp; Graphic Design at the University of Tampa. I also received my Master's in Social &amp; Emerging Media in 2022. Through various learning endevours, I built a strong foundation in collaborating on impactful projects for my agency, building a strong networking community in Tampa Bay through my membership in the Board of Counselors at the University of Tampa, and executing effective trafficking processes for my department. I remain deeply committed to fostering authentic connection and continuing to improve and hone in on skills that enhance my work quality and performance.
