        <p>
          I'm Kamryn, an Ad Tech Specialist with a strong expertise in campaign
          trafficking, digital media operations, and performance optimization.
          In my role, I manage and traffic all Publix campaigns, ensuring
          seamless execution and maximizing efficiency. I work closely with
          internal teams and external partners—including Spotify, Pandora, NBC,
          Hulu, and CBS—to streamline tag delivery and enhance campaign
          performance through various third party trackers (ex: Acxiom R-Tag).
          Additionally, I collaborate with various vendors to ensure accurate
          data measurement, campaign insights, and continuous improvements for
          Publix Media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally from Connecticut, I spent my most formative years in Tampa,
          Florida where I earned a degree in New Media &amp; Graphic Design at
          the University of Tampa. I also received my Master's in Social &amp;
          Emerging Media in 2022. Through various learning endevours, I built a
          strong foundation in collaborating on impactful projects for my
          agency, building a strong networking community in Tampa Bay through my
          membership in the Board of Counselors at the University of Tampa, and
          executing effective trafficking processes for my department. I remain
          deeply committed to fostering authentic connection and continuing to
          improve and hone in on skills that enhance my work quality and
          performance.
